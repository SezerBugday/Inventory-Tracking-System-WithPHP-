We made an inventory tracking system that allows the manager to keep track of items. Our project,provides appointment requests made by users, and also our website allows the administrator to make a list of equipment from which items can be made. Generally, this website helps users to request items and rooms. You can login to the system. Then it will be approved by the admin. Availability of items (equipment and rooms) and details of the user's request. After the user's account is approved by the administrator, users can log in to the site.and can request the item or room in the inventory by stating the reasons. Request (why they need the selected items) and the date and duration they want.They can buy things or use the rooms.
